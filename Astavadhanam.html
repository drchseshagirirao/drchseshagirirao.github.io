		    <p>Avadhanam, is an intellectual  discipline of highest order. This art refers to an ancient Indian skill, which  apparently has been dying &amp; there are very few living legends who can  perform. It is an exercise of the mind, which demands simultaneously, range and  focus. It subjects the Avadhani&rsquo;s awareness; concentration, poetic excellence,  retentive and analytical powers to the severest of tests. The Avadhani has to  acquire the capacity to let his mind dwell on a variety of challenging and  creative tasks set by Pruchchakas (Questioners), whose assigned role is to  elevate the exercise to its highest potential.   First, let&rsquo;s get the terminology out of the way:<br />
